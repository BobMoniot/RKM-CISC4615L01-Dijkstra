# RKM-CISC4615L01-Dijkstra
Base code for Data Comm &amp; Net class projects on Dijkstra shortest path.

I recommend you set up a development environment on your own computer.  You may also
opt to use erdos or storm.  If you need an account on one of those machines, I can
create it for you.

See the Blackboard project assignments for details about each project.  The Makefile
contains rules for both projects: shortest path and find routes.  The latter project
involves modifying shortest_path routine to turn it into find_routes.
